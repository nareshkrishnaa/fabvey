        5.Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Employee' 
         with properties for name and salary. Include a method to calculate annual
         salary. Create a subclass called 'Manager' that inherits from the 
         'Employee' class and adds an additional property for department. 
         Override the annual salary calculation method to include bonuses 
         for managers. Create two instances of the 'Manager' class and 
         calculate their annual salary.
